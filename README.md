# "my-front-end-projects" by renans2
Small yet funny front-end projects using JQuery.

Disclaimer: I did not put the "libraries" folder in the .gitignore, because I want you to be able to open and run the HTML's normally. This folder only contains the JQuery library which is very small (about 90KB), and that's why I kept it.
